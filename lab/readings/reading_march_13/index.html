<h1> Reading 4 </h1>

  The reading refers to html and css as a language and this thought got me thinking,
  is code universally written in the english language? Or does it depend on the text
  editor that the developer uses?

<p>
  Can the inspector tool help to find the detailed mistakes such as a missing curly bracket or colon?
  Can the inspector help better for some programs over others?
</p>

<p>
  I find it interesting that Javascript was known as other names previously and that marketing was
  involved in helping the language to gain popularity.  How often does marketing play a role in the
  ways and tools that developers use to produce their work?
