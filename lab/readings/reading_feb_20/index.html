<h1> Reading 3 </h1>
<h3> Describe why each writer thinks collecting is important. </h3>

<p>
  1) Kameelah Janan Rasheed collects out of curiosity.  She was raised to find her own answers to the questions that she had.
  She believes that collecting things and creating an archive is more fun than being stuck in a library.
<br>
<br>
  2) Rutherford Chang collected records all of the same album.  He collected them being that he was quickly intrigued by the
  fact of how even though they are all the same contents, they are all different. He also believes that some of these collections
  carry different ideas.
<br>
<br>
  3) By collecting we hold onto the things that we deem most important. Something that the author believes, is that we will never
  know what the future value of things will be. What the author loves about the internet's archive, is that it does not have a
  hierarchy system of what is most important to be saved, it just save it all.

<h3> Did these readings give you ideas on what you will collect or have already collected? If so, what were they? </h3>

<p>
  Since I was little, along with many other young girls, I have always been very drawn to sparkly objects.
  For my collection I have considered collecting glittery things.  This could be interesting because a collection
  of these things would paint a clear picture of what I deem to be appealing.
