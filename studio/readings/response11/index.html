<h1> Reading 11 </h1>

<p>
  I found it interesting when the reading stated "Difference should have reason".
  Everyone always wants to do things differently as a way of standing out, but I
  guess we should be putting more thought into what we make rather than focusing
  on just making it 'different'.
</p>

<p>
  "The idea of artists having special insights that operate beyond logic" I
  really like this statement, I think there definitely is something different
  about the way that artistically minded people think, and I like how this quote
  just accepts that.
